/// {@template flutter_spinbox.SpinBox}
/// A numeric input widget with an input field for entering a specific value,
/// and spin buttons for quick, convenient, and accurate value adjustments.
/// {@endtemplate}
///
/// ## Guidelines
///
/// Spin boxes are best suited for such applications
/// - that deal with large numeric value ranges and high precisions,
/// - where users typically know upfront the exact value they are entering,
/// - where users may later have a need to accurately adjust a previously
///   entered value.
///
/// As a rule of thumb, spin boxes are great for scenarios where
/// - sliders and alike UI controls are too inaccurate,
/// - tumblers and alike UI controls cannot provide enough value range,
/// - and a plain text field is inconvenient for value adjustments
///  (open the VKB, move the cursor, erase the previous value, enter a new
///   value... vs. tap-tap-done).
///
/// ## Designs
///
/// SpinBox for Flutter comes in two variants. It provides implementations for
/// both designs in Flutter, Material and Cupertino (iOS).
